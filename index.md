Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.hkust.edu.hk/en/home) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research focuses on the application of machine learning in the design and optimization of redox flow batteries. <!-- You can find abstracts, working papers, and a list of works in progress on my [research]({{site.baseurl}}/research/) page. --> 

Before coming to HKUST, I graduated from Harbin Institue of Technology with a BEng in [Material Science and Engineering](http://mse.hit.edu.cn/).

I will be on the 2022-2023 job market and I expect to graduate in 2022. 

When I am not in my office, I enjoy hiking and badminton.
