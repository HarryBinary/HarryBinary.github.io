Welcome to my website :blue_heart:  
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home). Currently, I am working with [Prof. Tianshou Zhao](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=tianshou-zhao-metzhao), co-supervized by [Prof. Ned Djilali](https://www.uvic.ca/research/labs/estp/people/researchers/djilali-ned.php) from [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/). My research lies in the interdisciplinary areas of artificial intelligence and energy storage devices, aiming at designing deivce components to optimize system performance. 

**Research Interests**  
 - Data-driven modelling
 - Battery simulation
 - Generative model
 - Optimization algorithm
