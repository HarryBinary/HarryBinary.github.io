Welcome! 
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home). My research focuses on the application of machine learning in the design and optimization of redox flow batteries. 
<!-- You can find abstracts, working papers, and a list of works in progress on my [research]({{site.baseurl}}/research/) page. --> 

Before coming to HKUST, I graduated from [Harbin Institue of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) with a B.Eng. in Material Science and Engineering.

In free time, I enjoy badminton, hiking, history, and light music.
